Data logging:

 

-      TI toolbox creates a BIN file

o   Logs point cloud

o   Logs ADC / 3D Spectrum

-      Use of camera

o   To check: Does TI allow to log camera

o   Plan B: Use a parallel tool for logging camera (will introduce a delay. To be checked: How long)

o   Maybe: Just take a picture of the room

-      Other sensor? PMD, 3 UDS

-      Simple situation like person walking in room

o   Simple segmentation in spectrum (all non-stationary is human)

o   Bubble around the walking speed (incl. micro-doppler)

-      Gesture:

 

Next steps:

-      January

o   Make a proposal for a data logging campaign (incl. reference  and/or a camera for visual inspection, choose length of data collection)

o   Make a proposal how/what to label (e.g. no need to do a full segmentation)

-      February:

o   Data logging

 

Next meeting 5th: February

- Need to re-book flights

 

- Human motion detection (gestures / gait)

 

- Decision necessary: Simulation or logs

 

- Necessary: Access to workstation

 

- TI Videos: Source code available

- Data card: Check memory on board / setting up the system

 

1. Step: Check all available TI-Examples and sensors that are relevant for gait / gesture

2. Step: Analyze technology that TI is using (do they use ML/AI)
